# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

### Project Title
This project is all about how to use Javascript and node.js together to built a full API (Application Programming Interface)

The Project has a title of Weather Jounrla which means you enter some sort of information like a ZipCode or the name of the country you want to know and the website replys with the Temperature rightaway.

### Development
It was hard for me to understand the course in once, but i watched the course like three times to fully understand how the system works,
I added some condition to make sure that the user will enter full information for the API to use.

I also re-styled the UI so that it would be well-looking for the user, I used Bootstrap version 5 to style the UI.

### Contribute
I watched alot of tutorials on how to build an API besides the course, such as [Learn API step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB5tpD0Y73w&t=645s), [Learn Fetch API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuEtnrL9-H0) and alot more.

I also watched this [Video] as a refferance for me (https://youtu.be/7IvDf6ksjlA) to know how to start in this project because it was kind hard for me at the start.
